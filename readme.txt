I got tired of notices that are added by Joost's plugin, so I made a thing to get rid of them. Then I noticed other things I didn't like. So I removed them too.

== Description ==

Honestly, I'm just sick of going into my wp-admin and seeing "YOAST!!!!!" all over the place. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ And then I noticed other things I didn't like about the plugin, so I got rid of those things too. And then Joost contacted me and said I don't have permission to use his trademark, so I changed the name to "Remove Admin Notices". Now I can block other plugins that have the same terrible practices.

== Installation ==
